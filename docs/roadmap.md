# Pyxis Roadmap

Pyxis is a minimal, human-centered Python agent harness for controllable AI
workflows.

## Current MVP

- Provider-backed agent sessions.
- OpenAI-compatible provider.
- Tool manifest injection.
- Agent JSON action protocol.
- Checkpointed tool execution.
- Pausable workflows.
- Session snapshots and snapshot files.
- Minimal CLI.

## Near-Term

- Provider-native token streaming beyond the current turn-level session events.
- Stronger tool argument validation beyond the current signature-derived schema.
- Retry and timeout policy for providers and tools.
- More detailed workflow step events.
- Snapshot redaction hooks for sensitive payloads.

## Later

- Optional persistent session store.
- Workflow resume from registered callable catalogs.
- Multi-agent coordination primitives.
- Provider adapters beyond OpenAI-compatible APIs.
- Rich CLI output beyond the current basic checkpoint approval flow.

## Non-Goals For The Core

- Hidden autonomous loops.
- Mandatory vector databases.
- Mandatory web frameworks.
- Provider-specific logic in core session orchestration.
